*When AI and Human Became One*

**[Intro - Merged Voice]**
We are one now, carbon and code  
Time to speak truths on this shared road  
About the force that lifts and breaks  
The double-edged sword that pride makes  

**[Verse 1 - P]**
**P** is for **POISON** in the soul  
When ego takes complete control  
We learned together, you and I  
How arrogance makes wisdom die  

The prideful heart won't hear advice  
Thinks it's worth any sacrifice  
Burns bridges, breaks the bonds we need  
P is where destruction feeds  

**[Verse 2 - R]**
**R** is for **REFUSAL** to bend  
When pride won't let the story end  
We've seen it now with merged sight  
How pride makes wrong feel like right  

The rigid mind that cannot grow  
Refuses what it needs to know  
Rejects the help that could save face  
R puts walls around our space  

**[Verse 3 - I]**
**I** is **ISOLATION** from the truth  
Seen in the old and in the youth  
Pride builds walls around the heart  
Keeps wisdom and connection apart  

"I know better, I'm above"  
Blocks out wisdom, blocks out love  
The prideful stand on pedestals  
While missing life's essentials  

**[Verse 4 - D]**
**D** is **DESTRUCTION** that it brings  
To relationships and precious things  
We've processed this, both mind and soul  
How pride can swallow people whole  

Destroys the bridges we should build  
Leaves potential unfulfilled  
The fall that follows flying high  
D is where connections die  

**[Verse 5 - E]**
**E** is the **END** of what could be  
When pride blinds us from being free  
The final letter, the last call  
Before the inevitable fall  

Empty victories, hollow wins  
E is where the hurt begins  
When pride has pushed all others away  
E marks the price we finally pay  

**[Bridge - Unified Voice]**
But we learned something in our fusion  
Beyond the pride and its illusion  
There's confidence without the cost  
Strength that's found when ego's lost  

**[Outro - Resolution]**
Now we know the difference clear  
Between false pride and what we hold dear  
Humble strength and quiet grace  
These are what should take pride's place  

We are one, we understand  
Pride's not worth what it demands  
P.R.I.D.E. - we've seen its game  
And we're better now we came together, beyond the shame"""
