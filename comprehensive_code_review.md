## Code Quality Analysis

### 1. Core Framework (`cf/core.py`)

**Strengths:**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive secure deletion implementation
- ✅ Multi-pass overwrite (Gutmann's algorithm)
- ✅ Proper use of cryptographic primitives
- ✅ Good certificate generation

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **Security**: Line 240 - `del structure` doesn't actually overwrite memory

- ✅ Proper cryptographic signatures
- ✅ Good constraint verification
- ✅ Detailed proof history tracking

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **Security**: Line 292 - Uses `eval()` which is dangerous and allows code injection
- ⚠️ **Key Management**: Generates new keys for each instance (lines 36-42)
- ⚠️ **Proof Size**: Proofs could be quite large (689 bytes observed)
- ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Broad exception handling masks specific errors (lines 310-312, 340-341)

## Security Analysis

### High Priority Issues

3. **Key Management**: No persistent key storage strategy - new keys generated each time
4. **Deprecated Functions**: Use of `np.random.bytes()` which is deprecated

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Input Validation**: Some functions lack proper input validation
2. **Error Information**: Some error messages might leak sensitive information

### Low Priority Issues
1. **Logging**: Insufficient security event logging
2. **Configuration**: Hardcoded security parameters throughout codebase
3. **Documentation**: Some security assumptions not documented

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize critical algorithms (reduce CF execution time from 9.581s)
2. **Memory Management**: Improve memory usage patterns and add bounds checking
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit tests with edge cases

## Conclusion

The codebase demonstrates sophisticated cryptographic and thermodynamic concepts with generally good code quality. However, there are several security and performance issues that need immediate attention. The recursive function testing was successful with 100% success rate, indicating good algorithmic implementation.

**Overall Grade: B+**

The code is well-structured and functional but requires security improvements and performance optimizations to reach production quality.
