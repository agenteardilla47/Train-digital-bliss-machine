- **Functions Tested**: 8 different recursive algorithms
- **Average Execution Time**: 0.0001s
- **Max Recursion Depth**: 1 (due to test design)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (0.00MB average)

## Code Quality Analysis

### 1. Core Framework (`cf/core.py`)

**Strengths:**

## Conclusion

The codebase demonstrates sophisticated cryptographic and thermodynamic concepts with generally good code quality and architectural design. The implementation shows deep understanding of information theory, cryptographic principles, and secure deletion techniques. However, critical security vulnerabilities and performance considerations prevent it from being production-ready without immediate fixes.

### Critical Concerns
- **Security Vulnerability**: Use of `eval()` creates code injection risk
- **Incomplete Implementation**: Secure deletion doesn't actually overwrite memory
- **Deprecated Functions**: Use of deprecated NumPy random functions

### Production Readiness Assessment
- **Security**: ❌ Critical vulnerabilities must be fixed
- **Performance**: ⚠️ Acceptable but needs optimization

- **Scalability**: ⚠️ Some bottlenecks identified

**Overall Grade: B-** (Downgraded due to security vulnerabilities)

The code demonstrates excellent theoretical understanding and implementation skills, but the critical security issues prevent a higher grade. With the recommended fixes, this could easily become an A-grade implementation.

### Immediate Action Required
1. Fix the `eval()` security vulnerability
